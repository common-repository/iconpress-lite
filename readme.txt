World’s first icon management interface for WordPress, redefining the standard of icon use, as the best alternative for font icons.

== Description ==

IconPress is the world’s first icon management interface for WordPress, an innovative tool for managing icons straight into your dashboard, redefining the standard of icon use, as the best alternative for font icons.

It all happens through an easy interface that's capable of inserting icons into your website's pages, through most of all major popular page builders and native WordPress super powers.

= THE MODERN ALTERNATIVE FOR FONT ICONS =

IconPress is the inevitable result of an improperly used technology. Fonts are not quite designed to host icons. They’re monochrome, they’re huge and most importantly they’re loaded as entire packs which really do slow your website.

IconPress is taking advantage of SVG technology, combining ONLY the icons you are using throughout your website, into a sprite. That’s really, really cool!!

Absolutely gorgeous icons, no http requests, no painfully large libraries of fonts resulting in a performance boost of your website.

= OVER 3600 BUILT-IN ICONS =

IconPress plugin is hosting some of the most popular icon libraries, such as [Web & Mobile Icon Bundle](https://creativemarket.com/kavoon?u=pixel-buddha), [Typicons](http://s-ings.com/typicons/), [Vivid Icons](https://dribbble.com/nitishkmrk/), [Entypo](http://www.entypo.com), [Open Iconic](https://github.com/iconic/open-iconic), [Linecons](httsp://designmodo.com/), [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com), [Material Icons](https://material.io/icons/), [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/), [Meteocons](http://www.alessioatzeni.com/meteocons/), [Devicon](http://konpa.github.io/devicon/)

Upgrade to [ICONPRESS PRO](https://iconpress.io/buy/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_campaign=readme&utm_medium=link) to access over 100.000 icons (and possibly much, much more) from IconFinder, straight into your WordPress dashboard or right into your page builder’s elements.

= SEARCH. TOGGLE ICON. SAVE! =

That’s right. It’s so easy to find an icon and add it. IconPress’s interface is fast (built with React) and intuitive.

= YOUR CUSTOM COLLECTION =

Upon saving, your chosen icons will be saved into your own collection. This collection is the only part that’s loaded into the frontend. No other icons, fonts or whatever, just those icons.

= Support for page builders, Gutenberg & shortcodes =

IconPress currently supports all major page builders, such as [WPBakery Page builder](https://codecanyon.net/item/visual-composer-page-builder-for-wordpress/242431), [Elementor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/elementor/) and [Beaver Builder](https://wordpress.org/plugins/beaver-builder-lite-version/). Others very soon!

Also, we’re part of WordPress’s future by having our very own Gutenberg block.

= ICON DECORATIONS =

Any icon can be accompanied by special, unique and creative decorations, with powerful customization options that will enhance your icons display.

[See decorations gallery](https://iconpress.io/icons-decorations-gallery/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_campaign=readme&utm_medium=link)

= Customize icons and generate various codes =

Customize icons color and size, and generate a code that fits your needs. Currently supporting SHORTCODE, SVG (both inline and embed) and PHP. We have built in functions that will easily inset any icon based on its id.

= Upload your own SVG icons =

Available in [ICONPRESS PRO](https://iconpress.io/buy/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_campaign=readme&utm_medium=link) .

You’re able to upload your own custom .svg icons and use it inside your website’s Media Library, Page builder elements, or everywhere in your website where you can paste a shortcode.

[See uploading in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=388&v=igM1NiLdtYM)

= SVG code editor =

Available in [ICONPRESS PRO](https://iconpress.io/buy/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_campaign=readme&utm_medium=link) .

If you’re planning on customizing your icons by changing some of their colors, or just adding or removing certain shapes, simply edit their code.

= WordPress Editor friendly =

When creating a new page you’ll always find the IconPress iconshort code button right above the editor.

= WordPress Customizer =

Theme developers can use IconPress app control, right into the WordPress’s Customizer.

= System locked icons =

Term given to icons that are hardcoded throughout IconPress, but mostly as a tool for theme and plugin developers, to include icons that cannot be removed by users.

= Entrance animations =

Make your icons enter in style with custom animations when scrolling into view. [See demos](https://iconpress.io/icons-decorations-gallery/#entrance_animations).

= Support for Demo import  =

You can bundle IconPress with your theme and include system icons, but mainly, you can safely export your sample data of a theme demo, using simple hooks. One Click Demo Import plugin supported!

= SVG Support into WordPress =

IconPress adds the posibility of viewing SVG thumbnails and uploading into Media Library, as well as inserting svg’s into the editor.
